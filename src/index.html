                Hi, my name is Nick! I am a first year MCS student in Chicago,
                and am excited to take this class along with many other cool
                ones!
            </p>

            <p>
                I work as a Software Engineer. In my free time, I enjoy playing
                the trumpet and piano. In undergrad at UIUC I actually was a
                member of the marching band! I also enjoy reading out by the
                lake and running (training for my first marathon currently)!
            </p>
